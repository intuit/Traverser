# Traverser: java library to walk object graph

<!-- add badges -->

[Traverser][Traverser] solves a one of the most common tasks to operate on tree or graph data structure: 

- enumerate tree or graph nodes into a traverse sequence
- execute client actions on each enumerated node 
- fine grained control of the traversal loop (continue, break, skip nodes)

It exposes rich and fine level of capabilities like:
- iterators 
- both depth- and breadth- first search (DFS/BFS)
- pre- and post- order actions
- cycle detection
- visitors
- global and local node contexts

It helps in several areas:
- speed up implementation by re-using generic  solution (stable, tested, well-performant solution)
- reduce codebase
- expand and adjust use cases with simple changes
- decouples traversing routine from data structure and client actions, which boosts maintenability

## Getting Started

Add dependency on this module and traverse any complex data structure.
Gradle: 
```
 compile 'com.intuit.commons:traverser:1.0.0'
```
Maven:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.intuit.commons</groupId>
    <artifactId>traverser</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```

## Local Development

```
./gradlew build
```

## Configuration

It is possible to override `version` and `group` of the artifact:
```
./gradlew clean -Pproject.version=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT -Pproject.group=com.intuit.commons  publishToMavenLocal
```
where `project.version` and `project.group` are used to control desired group and version. 
Artifact name is configured with `rootProject.name` property in *settings.gradle*.

## Learn by example 

Representing hierarchy of a medium-sized company is good example to illustrate key features of the traverser.  
```
Company 
    Bussiness Entity
          Teams
                Members
```

### Integration: children provider  
Tree or graph is a collection of connected nodes. Traversing a tree or graph is an enumeration of its nodes, 
i.e. iterating over the sequence of nodes and executing some actions for each node in that sequence. 
In order to advance to the next node(s) while pointing/acting on a certain node it is important to know how to discover
next nodes from the current one.

Usually the operation to discover descendants of a particular node is very specific to the data structure that models the tree.
For instance, if you consider traversing a directory tree, descendant objects would be files or directories in the current directory and 
discovery method would be based on `java.io.File` API. 

One of benefits of using generic traversing mechanism is to decouple actual traversing from data structure it is being operated on.
Regardless of the way data is organized, core algorithms does not change. But data, root element(s) as well as children of given parents 
must be be known to traverser in some way, so the algorithm can advance to the next element.  

Children provider is a *\<FUNCTION\>* that discovers children of a given parent element.
It could be passed as lamda-function or method reference or any other applicable means. 

In the simple form, children provider should expect a given node or parent object and output is a collection of child nodes.
```java
Function<T, Collection<T>>
```
Assuming the Company structure above, the simplest way to provide children is to use method reference (`Node::getChildren`):

```java
// create a Traverser for DFS traversal
 Traverser<Node, TraverseContext<Node>> traveser = Traverser.depthFirst(Node::getChildren);
```

In general case, children provider obtains a stream of [TraverseContext][TraverseContext] objects that wrap children of a given parent. 
This allows to customize the traversal sequence as well as to customize `TraverseContext` objects that go into that sequence. 
```java
BiFunction<Traverser<T, TraverseContext<T>, TraverseContext<T>, Stream<TraverseContext<T>>>>
```

```java
// create a Traverser for BFS traversal
Traverser<Node, TraverseContext<Node>> traverser = Traverser
    .breadthFirst((taverser, parent) -> parent.thisNode()   // the wrapped Node object
        .getChildren()
        .stream()
        .map(node -> traverser.newContext(parent, node))
        // for instance, you may set this variable(s) for each child context
        .map(context -> context.var(String.class, "Hello, world!"))   
);
```

### TraverseContext
[TraverseContext][TraverseContext] represents an environment around a node in the traversal sequence. It contains a reference to the tree or graph node, reference to the parent `TraverseContext`, both local and "inherited" variables and optionally calculation result. 

### Iterator

[Iterator][TraversingIterator] is build on top of graph/tree traversal and shares common API.
There are 2 flavors (go deep or go broad) of direction and 2 flavours (before or after) of invocation.
This yields 4 total possible combinations of how iteration can be performed. 

Iterators allow to traverse the underlying tree or graph in a simple loop as if they were iterating over a sequence of tree or graph nodes.
> `TraversingIterator` has method `path` to obtain node's path to the root node the traversing started from. 
It also can manipulate with the current `TraverseContext` via `replace` method.

#### Depth-First traversing   

For a given tree or graph node, depth-first traversal always follows children before considering siblings:

##### Perform an action, then move to next

Nodes are enumerated in the depth-first order 

```java
// populate the company according example at the top of this discussion
Company c = new Company("Company")
    .businessEntity(new BusinessEntity("BU-Pacific")
        .team(new Team("PD=Product Development")
            .member(new Member("Sylvester Moonstone"))
            .member(new Member("John Smith"))

### Traversal loop control

At the core, Traverser enumerates nodes in the internal traversal loop.       
Traveser uses [visitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern) to take actions for each enumerated node.
Results of visitor's actions control traverser internal loop.

* `CONTINUE`
  
  discover children of the current node and continue the loop
    
* `SKIP`

  skip children of the current node, but continue the loop
  
* `QUIT`

  quit (break) the loop

Visitor's actions are methods of [TraverseVisitor][TraverseVisitor] interface called by [Traverser][Traverser] at the specific moments during traversal.
When a Traverser is about to process a node the very first time, it calls `enter` method, which is a **pre-order** action.
If the result is `CONTINUE`, Traverser discovers children of the current node, so they could be processed too.
After all children of the current node have been processed, `Traverser` calls `leave` method to execute a **post-order** action.
If a node has been already processed, Traverser calls `onBackRef` method to execute an action on a **cyclicly** referenced node.
In order to avoid infinite recursion loop, Traverser does not discover children of such node, similar to the effect of `SKIP` action result.

#### Execute both pre- and post- order actions
```java
// populate the company according example at the top of this discussion
Company c = ...;

// create depth-first traverser and execute it
boolean foundKleoRuby = Traverser
    .depthFirst(Node::getChildren)
    .traverse(c, false, new TraverseVisitor<Node, TraverseContext<Node>>() {
       public Traverser.Action enter (TraverseContext<Node> context) {
            Node node = context.thisNode();
            System.out.println("enter: " + node.getName());
